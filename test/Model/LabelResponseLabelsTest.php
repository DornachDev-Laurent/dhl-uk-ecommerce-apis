/**
 * DHL eCommerce UK API
 *
 * The DHL eCommerce UK API allows customers and partners to:  - Get available products based on delivery address and parcel size.  - Find servicepoints in the UK or worldwide.  - Create new shipments and optionally return labels.  - Get shipment customs documents.  - Request shipment cancellation.  - Request shipment amendment.  - Regenerate labels ready for reprinting.  - Get details of customer trading locations.  - Request a driver pickup from a customer trading location.  - Get information about driver pickups already requested.  - Track shipments.  - Get DHL eCommerce UK reference data to help you provide valid shipment data from your applications.  - Add a What 3 Words to a domestic shipment.  - Find a DHL Parcels Depot.   **`API Authentications:`** All API operations require an access token to be passed in the Authorization Header for each request. The token type is an OAuth 2.0 Bearer token. To get the token you have to call the Authentication operation of this API and provide **client_id** and **client_secret**. The Access Token is valid for defined amount of time so it is not necessary to request the token for each request. Developers should implement the client application in a way that the token will be requested again only after it expires.  **`Access Token Lifecycle:`** When you receive an Access Token, it is valid for 60 minutes. During this time, you don't have to request new token per each request, but you can simply reuse the same token to access API resources, until the token expires. The invalid token or token expiration will be indicated by HTTP Status Code 401 Unauthorized, then your application has to request new Access Token.    **Recommended sequence for creating a shipment with the Shipping Label API is as follows:**        1.  Use client_id and client_secret to authenticate and obtain an access token using /auth/v1/accesstoken (see details below). A client_id and client_secret can be obtained by registering on the DHL developer portal and then registering an app in the user dashboard.   2.  Prepare valid JSON request as per Shipping Label API POST request schema (see examples below). Use data above depending on your use-case.   3.  Send an API request the correct API endpoint for test/UAT or live/production:          test: https://api-uat.dhl.com/parceluk/shipping/v1/label              live: https://api.dhl.com/parceluk/shipping/v1/label          If the shipment request is valid and accepted then a new shipmentId and optionally labels will be returned in the response.  **Sample Pickup Accounts And Product codes:**    To test using the Shipping Label API, you may use the following accounts and additional settings.
